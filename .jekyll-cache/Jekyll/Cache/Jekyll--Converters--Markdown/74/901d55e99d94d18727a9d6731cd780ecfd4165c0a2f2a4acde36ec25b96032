  <li> I studied computer science at Galileo University. Along with my CS courses y studied abstract algebra, topology, analysis, and differential geometry but ultimately my primary interests are deep learning, blockchain, and high-performance computing. Iâ€™m interested in how the algorithms that perform well in AI can be explained mathematically and how this can help to improve all the current techniques. Iâ€™m also interested in Information Theory &amp; Data Science. </li>
