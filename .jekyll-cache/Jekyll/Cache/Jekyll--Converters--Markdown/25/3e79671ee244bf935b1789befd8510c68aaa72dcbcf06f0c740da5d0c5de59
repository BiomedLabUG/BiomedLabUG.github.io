<p>Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:</p>

<p><strong>Detection and Classification of Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular Diseases using Computed Tomography.</strong>

<p>We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.</p>

Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.</p>

<p>Registration of dynamic CT image sequences is a necessary preprocessing step for accurate assessment of multiple (patho)physiological determinants in the heart such as myocardial perfusion. In this work we present a recursive-cascade-network approach for deformable image registration using data from myocardial perfusion CT studies. A contrast-agent dependent loss function was introduced which enabled us to further improve the accuracy of sequence registration. In addition, different network configurations were evaluated, showing a good trade-off between spatial registration accuracy and image quality.</p>
