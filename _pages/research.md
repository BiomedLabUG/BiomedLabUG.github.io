# Research
Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Detection and Classification of Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular Diseases using Computed Tomography.**

The project aims to design and implement a computer-assisted diagnostic tool that allows early detection and classification of hemorrhages from CT images, using convolutional networks and methods for interpretability as a first approximation to unsupervised localization. of hemorrhages.

The project aims at the early detection and localization of ischemic cerebrovascular events using computed tomography images without contrast medium. The tool is based on the design and implementation of convolutional network architectures that allow the semantic segmentation of the areas damaged by acute strokes.

**Early Detection of Myocardial Damage Using Computed Tomography of the Heart**.
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/compinBiology.jpg){: style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px  10px"}

The project consists of the use of Artificial Intelligence for the early detection of myocardial ischemia from Cardiac Computed Tomographs with contrast medium. For this, the objective is to design and implement neural network architectures for the analysis of time series of cardiac volumes that allow the early detection and localization of ischemia.
