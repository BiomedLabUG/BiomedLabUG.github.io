  description: "Review on clinical applications, quality of datasets, preprocessing and annotation, learning methods and training strategy, and test performance. Clinical usability was evaluated based on these criteria by classifying the selected papers into (i) clinical level, (ii) robust candidate and (iii) proof of concept applications. In summary, deep learning in spatiotemporal cardiac imaging is still strongly research-oriented and its implementation in clinical application still requires considerable efforts. Challenges that need to be addressed are the quality of datasets together with clinical verification and validation of the performance achieved by the used method."

- title: "Deep Learning Based Image Registration in Dynamic Cardiac CT using a Recursive Cascade Network approach"
  image: reg.png
  description: "Registration of dynamic CT image sequences is a necessary preprocessing step for accurate assessment of multiple (patho)physiological determinants in the heart such as myocardial perfusion. In this work we present a recursive-cascade-network approach for deformable image registration using data from myocardial perfusion CT studies. A contrast-agent dependent loss function was introduced which enabled us to further improve the accuracy of sequence registration. In addition, different network configurations were evaluated, showing a good trade-off between spatial registration accuracy and image quality."
