- title: "Deep learning in spatiotemporal cardiac imaging: A review of methodologies and clinical usability"
  image: compinBiology.jpg
  description: Review on clinical applications, quality of datasets, preprocessing
and annotation, learning methods and training strategy, and test performance. Clinical usability was
evaluated based on these criteria by classifying the selected papers into (i) clinical level, (ii) robust candidate and
(iii) proof of concept applications. In summary, deep learning in spatiotemporal cardiac imaging is still strongly research-oriented
and its implementation in clinical application still requires considerable efforts. Challenges that need to be
addressed are the quality of datasets together with clinical verification and validation of the performance achieved
by the used method.
