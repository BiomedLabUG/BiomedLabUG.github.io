  education1: I studied computer science at Galileo University. Along with my CS courses y studied abstract algebra, topology, analysis, and differential geometry but ultimately my primary interests are deep learning, blockchain, and high-performance computing. I’m interested in how the algorithms that perform well in AI can be explained mathematically and how this can help to improve all the current techniques. I’m also interested in Information Theory & Data Science.
